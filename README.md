# Arduboy-BistercianNumbers

Tiny 4x4 Numerical Display of Bistercian numbers for the Arduboy system.

Bistercian numbers are cistercian numbers represented as a composition of binary numbers visualized in a 2x2 square space. Due to being cistercian numbers they allow the representation of a numeral value up to 9999 on a 4x4 space.

Cistercian single digits numbers go from 1 to 9, but to allow bigger numbers (one bistercian number after another) bistercian numbers go from 0 to 9, this also makes the information in a 2x2 square complete without leaving an empty space, meaning a zero has a specific visual representation the same way a zero is represented by the character '0' (a completely empty space in bistercian number is not possible as a 0 value, since [0000] is represented as the composition of all zeros in all the corners of a bistercian number, and a zero is represented by one pixel).
